# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Purpose of This Repository
The purpose of this repository is to document and explore the concept of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It serves as a guide for understanding its importance, key activities, and practical implementation in projects.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a process in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves understanding and documenting what is required from the software to meet the needs of its stakeholders. It is a critical phase where software requirements are identified, analyzed, and refined to ensure clarity and feasibility.

Requirement Analysis ensures that all stakeholders, including clients, end-users, and development teams, have a clear understanding of what the software should achieve. It forms the foundation for designing, developing, and testing the system effectively.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. **Minimizes Miscommunication**  
   Proper requirement analysis ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project scope and goals, reducing misunderstandings and rework.

2. **Saves Time and Costs**  
   Identifying and addressing potential issues early in the process helps avoid costly changes during later stages of development.

3. **Ensures Project Success**  
   Clear and detailed requirements improve the likelihood of delivering a product that meets user needs and expectations.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and other techniques.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Exploring and clarifying stakeholder needs by engaging in discussions, prototyping, and use case development.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Recording requirements in a structured format, such as use cases, user stories, or requirement specifications.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyzing the feasibility, risks, and impact of requirements and representing them visually through diagrams or models.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Ensuring that the requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are aligned with the project objectives.

## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements
These are the specific functionalities or behaviors the system must perform. For a booking management project:
- Users should be able to search for available bookings by date and location.
- The system should allow users to create, update, or cancel bookings.
- Administrators can generate reports of bookings by month.

### Non-functional Requirements
These define the quality attributes of the system. For the same booking management project:
- The system must handle 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- Booking transactions should be processed within 3 seconds.
- The system must ensure data encryption for all sensitive user information.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between actors and the system. They help in understanding and clarifying requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that a software feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders. They ensure that the development team and stakeholders share a common understanding of the feature's expected behavior.

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria
- Provide clear expectations for the development team.
- Ensure alignment between stakeholder requirements and the delivered solution.
- Serve as a basis for test case creation.

### Example: Checkout Feature
- The user can add items to the cart and proceed to checkout.
- The system validates payment details before processing the transaction.
- A confirmation email is sent to the user upon successful payment.
